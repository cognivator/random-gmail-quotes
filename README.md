  I made this extension because I couldn't find a tool to let me randomly inject my own user-selected
  quotes into my email signature. I specifically wanted the quotes to be hand-selected. 
 
  Since there wasn't an existing solution, I made one.
 
  To replace the quotes with your own, edite the quotes.js file. You may use HTML markup, but be sure
  to escape your quotation marks!
