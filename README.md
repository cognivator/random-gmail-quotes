  I made this extension because I couldn't find a tool to let me randomly inject my own user-selected
  quotes into my email signature. I specifically wanted the quotes to be hand-selected. 
 
  Since there wasn't an existing solution, I made one.
 
  To replace the quotes with your own, edit the quotes.js file. You may use HTML markup, but be sure
  to escape your quotation marks!

  Alternatively, if you don't want to hack the code, on the right side of the address bar in your
  Gmail tab, click the page action icon and edit the JSON array with your own quotes. Just be sure 
  to save that data to a backup file, just in case!
 
  In case it isn't clear, this is licensed under the MIT License. So do with this what you please.

// @history        0.9.2 initial beta release to the public in the Chrome Web Store with Stack Exchange flair import support

I added in the ability for Stack Exchange users to instantly replace the quotes with their Stack Exchange flair. Just go to 
your Stack Overflow profile page and click the page action icon next to the "Favorites" star in the address bar, when the page
action loads up your flair, click "Use as Gmail signature instead of quotes".
